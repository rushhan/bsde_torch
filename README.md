# bsde_torch
A pytorch implementation of Backward Stochastic Differential Equation

# [Deep BSDE Solver](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718942115) in Torch

## To execute:
```
python main.py
```

## Currently Supports and Tested (CPU only):
* `HJBLQ`: Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation.

More to follow!!

## Dependencies
torch 1.10.0

## Note and Thanks:
This Repo is heavily based on the work done by [[frankhan91]](https://github.com/frankhan91). THe original work is in Tensorflow and can be found [[here]](https://github.com/frankhan91/DeepBSDE). The current model reuses the same network for all the subswquent time step insteaad of creating new for each time step. This greatly reduced the parameters to train (about 1/20 the of the tf counterpart).
